Prototype Branch
=================

This branch is to hold examples and prototypes which are relevant to the project, but will never be incorporated into the master branch

UDP Test:
    Demonstrates sending messages from another computer to a unity application running on an Android phone

Sound_Glider:
    Uses the FFT of a predetermined sound file to extrude a basic terrain shape. We will need to create
    the sounds dynamically and create a much more complex terrain, but htis can serve as a basic starting point.
